The rapid advancement in technology has led to the development of sophisticated safety-critical
systems, particularly in commercial settings such as restaurants, fuel storage facilities, and industrial 
kitchens.Among these, fire and gas safety systems play a pivotal role in ensuring the safety of
individuals and the protection of assets. In this context, the project focuses on the design and
implementation of a real-time operating system (RTOS) based Fire & Gas safety critical system for
commercial use.
The system utilizes the INDUS Development Board (STM32G431MBT6) as the core platform and
integrates  various  hardware  components  including  a  Stepper  Motor, ADS1115  MODULE  (16 bit ADC), 
OLED Display (SSD1306 168x64), LPG Sensor (MQ-5), Flame Sensor (DFR0076), CO
Sensor (MQ-7), and Buzzer (ON-BOARD). Software development is done using STM32 CubeIDE
and FreeRTOS (CMSIS V1), with version control managed through GitHub.
The primary objective of the project is to create a versatile device that can be employed in both
restaurant kitchen and fuel storage facilities. The system is designed to detect and respond to fire and
gas hazards promptly, ensuring the safety of occupants and minimizing the risk of property damage.
By implementing a robust RTOS-based solution, the project aims to provide a reliable and efficient
safety-critical system suitable for commercial applications.
